# dotfiles
My Dotfiles for Hyprland (Arch). here will be my first dotfiles :p

> [!WARNING]
> This is NOT a project to follow up on, or maybe wait for an install script. This is my dotfiles, just for fun. 

> [!NOTE]
> I would like to add a note here too, that i dont have any experience with Hyprland. The only hyprland experience i have is from instaling random dotfiles, and then installing KDE.




# TODO:
- [ ] Clean install of Hyprland
- [ ] Waybar configuration
- [ ] My own fastfetch config
- [ ] Some kind of launcher?
